# HTL Pinkafeld Informatik Diplomarbeit

This is a LaTeX template for a diploma thesis at HTL Pinkafeld, department for Informatics. 

It was compiled by Thomas Quaritsch in 2019 based on [Karl Voit's KOMAscript template](https://github.com/novoid/LaTeX-KOMA-template) and [Thomas Quaritsch's longdoc template](https://github.com/tquaritsch/latex-koma-longdoc). 

It's use is not compulsory (use MS Word if you want to :)) and basic understanding of LaTeX is required. Some LaTeX commands to include graphics, references, tables, listings etc. are explained in the template's example content itself. 

This template can be used via [overleaf.com](overleaf.com).
