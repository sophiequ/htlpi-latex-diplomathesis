# ==============================================================================
# Template for a BibLaTeX database as of version 2.7a (2013-07-14)
# containing all entry types, each containing all possible entry fields.
# The required fields are written in upper case (Note: for all entry types, 
# date can be specified instead of year if desired, and for some types the 
# editor field can replace the mandatory author field).
# ==============================================================================
#
# ==============================================================================
# The following descriptions for the usage of the individual entry types are 
# taken from the biblatex manual. 
# ------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# article: article in a journal, magazine, newspaper or other periodical which 
#     forms a self-contained unit with its own title. 
# book: a single-volume book with one or more authors where the authors share 
#     credit for the work as a whole
# mvbook: A multi-volume book
# inbook: A part of a book which forms a self-contained unit with its own title.
# bookinbook: This type is similar to inbook but intended for works originally 
#     published as a stand-alone book (e.g. collected works of an author).
# suppbook: Supplemental material in a book (e.g. preface, forewords, ...). 
#     Standard styles will treat this entry type as an alias for inbook.
# booklet: A book-like work without a formal publisher or sponsoring 
#     institution. Use the Ô¨Åeld howpublished to supply publishing information.
# collection: A single-volume collection with multiple, self-contained 
#     contributions by distinct authors which have their own title.
# mvcollection: A multi-volume collection.
# incollection: A contribution to a collection which forms a self-contained unit 
#     with a distinct author and title. 
# suppcollection: Supplemental material in a collection (similar to suppbook).
# manual: Technical or other documentation, not necessarily in printed form.
# misc: A fallback type for entries which do not fit into any other category. 
#     Use the field howpublished to supply publishing information.
# online: An online resource. author, editor, and year are omissible. Note that 
#     the url field can be used on other entry types to supply a URL.
# patent: A patent or patent request.
# periodical: Complete issue of a periodical, such as a special issue of a journal.
# suppperiodical: Supplemental material in a periodical (similar to suppbook).
# proceedings: A single-volume conference proceedings (similar to collection)

# inproceedings: An article in a conference proceedings (similar to incollection).
# reference: A single-volume work of reference such as an encyclopedia or a dictionary.
# mvreference: A multi-volume reference entry (standard styles will treat this as
#     an alias for mvcollection).
# inreference: An article in a work of reference (like incollection).
# report: A technical report, research report, or white paper published by a 
#     university or some other institution.
# thesis: A thesis written for an educational institution to satisfy the 
#     requirements for a degree.
